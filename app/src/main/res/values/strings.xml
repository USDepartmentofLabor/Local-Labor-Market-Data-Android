    <string name="about">About</string>
    <string name="about1">The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Local Labor Market Data app presents data on unemployment rates and employment by industry and occupation for states, metro areas, and counties. The most recent figures are presented, although the latest available data will vary by data type and geography.</string>
    <string name="about2">New England metro areas shown in this app are delineated by New England cities and towns (NECTAs).  In all other states, metropolitan areas are county-based</string>
    <string name="about3">National unemployment rate comes from the Current Population Survey (CPS), while state, metro area, and county unemployment rates come from the Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) program.</string>
    <string name="about4">National, state, and metro area employment by industry comes from the Current Employment Statistics (CES) program.</string>
    <string name="about5">County employment and wages by industry come from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) program.</string>
    <string name="about6">National, state, and metro area employment and wages by occupation come from the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) program.</string>
    <string name="about7">The Local Labor Market Data app presents both seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted data where available. Note that seasonally adjusted data are not generally available for metro areas and counties.</string>

    <string name="glossary">Glossary</string>
    <string name="glossaryTitle1">1-month change</string>
    <string name="glossary1">The change in a data value between the current displayed month and the immediately preceding month.  Note that when viewing not seasonally adjusted data, the 1-month change may be primarily driven by seasonal factors.</string>
    <string name="glossaryTitle2">12-month change</string>
    <string name="glossary2">The change in a data value between the current displayed month and the same month in the previous calendar year.  The 12-month change value is not affected by seasonal factors.</string>
    <string name="glossaryTitle3">Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)</string>
    <string name="glossary3">A large population nucleus, together with adjacent communities which have a high degree of economic and social integration with that nucleus. These communities are defined by the Office of Management and Budget as a standard for federal agencies in the preparation and publication of statistics relating to metropolitan areas.</string>
    <string name="glossaryTitle4">N/A</string>
    <string name="glossary4">Data not available.  This may result when data cannot be released due to data confidentiality or quality concerns or when a data element is not produced, due to changes in classifications or other survey changes.  Data are also not available on a seasonally adjusted basis for some data elements.</string>
    <string name="glossaryTitle5">Seasonally adjusted</string>
    <string name="glossary5">Seasonal adjustment removes the effects of events that follow a more or less regular pattern each year. These adjustments make it easier to observe the cyclical and other nonseasonal movements in a data series.  Only certain data elements are available on a seasonally adjusted basis; when only not seasonally adjusted data are available, the app will display N/A for a data value when seasonally adjusted is selected.</string>
    <string name="glossaryTitle6">Unemployment rate</string>
    <string name="glossary6">The unemployment rate represents the number of unemployed (persons who had no employment, were available for work, and had made specific efforts to find employment) as a percent of the labor force (all persons employed and unemployed).</string>
